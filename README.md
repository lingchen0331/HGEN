# HGEN
The code of ICDM'21 paper "Deep Generation of Heterogeneous Networks"

The code has been tested under Python 3.7 and Pytorch 1.7.1

For the real-world heterogneous graph inference:
```
python hgen.py
```

For the synthetic heterogneous graph inference:
```
python hgen_syn.py
```

All the hyperparameters are tuned and dataset have been attached.
